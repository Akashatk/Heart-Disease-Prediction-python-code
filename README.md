The prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) as a leading cause of mortality worldwide 
underscores the critical necessity for the development of effective predictive tools. In response 
to this imperative, this paper delves into the conceptualization, development, and 
implementation of a Heart Disease Prediction System (HDPS) using machine learning 
algorithms. By leveraging a myriad of medical attributes encompassing age, gender, chest pain 
symptoms, and fasting blood sugar levels, our system endeavors to accurately classify patients 
into those likely to have heart disease and those not. The prevalence of cardiovascular diseases

A fundamental aspect of our study is the exploration and evaluation of multiple machine 
learning algorithms, including but not limited to Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors 
(KNN), and Random Forest Classifier. This comparative analysis underscores the importance 
of employing diverse techniques to enhance the accuracy of predictions. Each algorithm brings 
its unique strengths and limitations to the table, and by meticulously assessing their 
performance, we aim to identify the most effective approach for heart disease prediction.
